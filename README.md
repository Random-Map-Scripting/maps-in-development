## Reverse Arena
It's like Arena - except your walls are around the other player.
To do: 
* move second goal inside walls
* make a back gold?
* fix neutral gold/stone locations
* look at relic locations

## Bog Socratra
It's like socratra - but boggier.

## Ponds
It's like islands - but the opposite. 
To do: 
* less fish?
* look at player/pond starts?
