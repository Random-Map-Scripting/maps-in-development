# To use: 
Copy and paste map into text file with filename ending with .rms (or you can download all maps in a zip file by clicking the green code button above). 

Paste the file into your AoE game directory - path should look something like /resources/_common/random-map-scripts. (You may have to make a random-map-scripts folder if it doesn't already exist).
